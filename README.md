# VolatileWatch - Real-time Volatility Monitoring and Alerting System

VolatileWatch is a robust and scalable system designed for continuous monitoring of data volatility and triggering alerts based on predefined thresholds. It allows users to observe the rate of change in specified data sources, providing critical insights into the stability and predictability of various systems. This can be particularly useful in financial markets, network monitoring, and other areas where rapid changes can indicate significant events or potential problems.

The system focuses on providing a flexible and extensible framework for volatility analysis. It is built using TypeScript, ensuring type safety and maintainability. VolatileWatch can ingest data from multiple sources, calculate volatility metrics using configurable algorithms, and generate alerts via various channels, such as email, Slack, or custom webhooks. The core principle is to provide a near real-time view of data flux, enabling proactive decision-making and timely intervention in dynamic environments.

The system's modular architecture allows for easy integration with existing infrastructure. Data sources can be added or modified without impacting other components. The volatility calculation algorithms are also designed to be pluggable, allowing users to experiment with different methods to best suit their specific needs. VolatileWatch provides a comprehensive solution for anyone seeking to understand and react to data volatility.

## Key Features

*   **Configurable Data Sources:** Supports integration with diverse data sources through modular adapter architecture. Adapters can be custom-built for specific APIs, databases, or message queues. Example: Implementing a `DataSource` class that connects to a Redis instance and streams data.
*   **Pluggable Volatility Algorithms:** Offers a selection of pre-built volatility calculation algorithms, including standard deviation, variance, and exponential moving average. New algorithms can be easily added by implementing the `VolatilityAlgorithm` interface.
*   **Threshold-Based Alerting:** Allows users to define custom thresholds for volatility metrics and configure alerts to be triggered when these thresholds are breached. Thresholds can be dynamic and adjusted based on historical data.
*   **Multiple Alert Channels:** Supports multiple alert channels, including email, Slack, and custom webhooks. This allows users to receive alerts through their preferred communication channels. Example: Configuring a Slack webhook using environment variables.
*   **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard:** Provides a web-based dashboard for visualizing volatility metrics and alert history. The dashboard is built using React and provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring system performance.
*   **API for External Integration:** Exposes a REST API for external integration, allowing other applications to access volatility metrics and trigger alerts programmatically. API endpoints are documented using Swagger/OpenAPI specifications.
*   **Data Persistence:** Persists calculated volatility metrics and alert history to a database for historical analysis and reporting. Supports multiple database backends, such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The primary programming language, providing type safety and improved code maintainability.
*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment for the backend server.
*   **Express.js:** A web framework for building the REST API and server-side logic.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building the user interface of the monitoring dashboard.
*   **PostgreSQL (or MongoDB):** A database for storing volatility metrics and alert history. The choice depends on the specific requirements for data storage and retrieval.
*   **Redis (Optional):** A caching layer for improving performance and reducing database load.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/uhsr/VolatileWatch.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd VolatileWatch`
3.  Install dependencies:
    `npm install`
4.  Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and configure the environment variables (see Configuration section).
5.  Build the TypeScript code:
    `npm run build`
6.  Start the server:
    `npm start`

## Configuration

The following environment variables need to be configured in the `.env` file:

*   `PORT`: The port on which the server will listen (e.g., `3000`).
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for the PostgreSQL or MongoDB database.
*   `REDIS_URL` (Optional): The connection string for the Redis server.
*   `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (Optional): The URL for the Slack webhook.
*   `EMAIL_HOST` (Optional): The hostname for the email server.
*   `EMAIL_PORT` (Optional): The port for the email server.
*   `EMAIL_USER` (Optional): The username for the email server.
*   `EMAIL_PASSWORD` (Optional): The password for the email server.

Example `.env` file:



## Usage

After installation and configuration, the VolatileWatch system can be accessed through the following endpoints:

*   `/api/volatility`: Returns the current volatility metrics for all configured data sources.
*   `/api/alerts`: Returns the history of triggered alerts.
*   `/dashboard`: Accesses the real-time monitoring dashboard.

The API documentation can be accessed at `/api-docs` (using Swagger/OpenAPI). Example request:

`curl http://localhost:3000/api/volatility`

This will return a JSON response containing the volatility metrics. Data can be posted to the system using the adapter architecture.
